          Iâ€™m an Information & Technology alumni from Eastern Mediterranean
          University, Cyprus. I am passionate about Web development and
          currently, I work with NextJS and React. I also enjoy scripting and
          other fields that help me automate my tasks. I am currently learning
          how to work better with algorithms and data structures. I like to
          practice my skills on sites like Frontend Mentor, Code wars, CSS
          battle, Hackerrank and Try Hack Me. I am currently working as a
          Frontend Web Developer at Rapid River / Internet Brands.
